    * floating-point, numbers, booleans and characters
    * Integer: i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize
    * Unsigned Integer: u8, u16, u32...
    *
    * isize represents 64 bits if you are using a 64-bits architeture or 32 if you are using 32-bit (Used in collections)
    * architeture
    *
    * Representations:
    *
    * Decimal: 1_000 = 1000
    * Hex:     0xff = 16Â² + 16
    * Octal:   0o77 = 8Â² + 8
    * Binary:  0b1000_0000 = 128
    * Byte:    b'A'

     * Release mode:
